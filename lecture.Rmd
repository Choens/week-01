# What is data science? (1/2)

[From Wikipedia: Data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)

> Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine
> learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and
> analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs techniques and
> theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics,
> statistics, information science, and computer science.

# Course objectives

- Master importing, manipulating and reporting on data.
- Learn how to use R for hypothesis testing/modeling.
- Learn about alternatives to null hypothesis testing.
- Become a more independent R user.
    - Learning R is not easy. I will be thrilled if each of you feels comfortable tackling a new data-based challenge on your own by the end of this semester.
    - I know this isn't easy. We are building on Intro to Data.
    - And we are going to have some fun. Seriously. We will. . . . 



# Class structure

- Lecture will be uploaded to Canvas every week.
  - I pray doing these lectures gets easier.
- We will have a midterm and a final exam.
- There are three (3) projects we will work on together.
    - I have not yet decided what we will do with these projects.
    - Think of them as bigger/more ambitious labs.
    - I will give you a set of questions and point you at some data.
    - Each project will take three weeks, which should give us some time to have some fun and dig into the data.
    - Peer review for the win!!!!
- There are a series of discussion, "Beyond The Numbers"
  - Similar to what we did in Intro To Data (although different topics).
  - Just class discussions, not papers!



# This Week's Reading

Review:

- R Basics
- Transition to R

Really Useful:

- R projects
- Import and export



# Installing R/RStudio

- In the Lecture/Reading assignment for this week I have provided download links for R & RStudio.
- Please try to have these two things installed by Friday.
- But if you get stuck let me know.


# Data File Formats

- ðŸ¥± ðŸ¥± ðŸ¥±
- I know. Get yourself a â˜• and we'll do this!
- The first step towards importing data is understanding how it is formatted.

# Data
<small>

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(starwars)
```
</small>

# So, Square

- CSV (Comma Separated Values)
    - TSV
    - Pipe Delimited
    - etc.
- Excel (oooooohhhhh, aaaahhhhhhhh)
- XML
- YAML



# Questions/Concerns

- Learning how to program is not easy.
- Google, StackOverflow, etc. are your friend.
- Office Hours: Fridays from 1:00 - 2:00 PM.
  - 4:00 - 5:00 by appointment only



# Lab

- Based on feedback from prior years, trying a new lab structure.
  - Remote lecture (this thing I'm doing right now!)
  - Friday, in-person lab.
  - Some labs may be preceded by a class discussion.
  - Labs will build on the material introduced in the lecture/readings.
  - Please come prepared.
- We will start the lab together. I will stay as long as needed to
  answer questions. You may leave at any time although I recommend
  staying and working through the lab.



# My Videos

- This is my first try at remote lectures.
- Please feel free to give me feedback about how I'm doing this.
